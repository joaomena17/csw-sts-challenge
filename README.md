# csw-sts-challenge
Repository for the Platoon Clone Warriors

This repo contains our STS Challenge - IoT Project which consists of an IoT sensor data generator
serving a MQTT broker connected to a Web Server in a Publish-Subscribe architecture. The Web Server
will have a REST API to acess the sensor data which will be stored in a SQLite database. There will
also be a user interface with a natural language query feature by integrating OpenAI's GPT-3.5.
